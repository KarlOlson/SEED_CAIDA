Internet Emulator - CAIDA Sample
---

This package modifies the SEED Internet Emulator to make all router interfaces "pingable" within the topology (subject to peering relationships and network topology reachability) by extending the IX OSPF network and internal AS network redistribution.

This also includes a number of additional modifiers used to test varying topology deployment scenarios:
- Proxy Random Assignment Modifier
- DB Scenario Builder/Deployment
- Proxy functionality for: Route Origin Validation, Path Validation, Route SLA Cost, Performance Metrics
